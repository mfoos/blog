Today, while researching this blog post, I learned that there are KINDS of lightning talks. One of them is called "Ignite" so that's the source of the title. As organizer for [R-Ladies Boston](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-Boston/), I'm recruiting for lightning talks for our next meetup. The folks who don't need to be asked twice have already signed up, so now I'm aiming for the second line: folks who are interested/excited/curious about lightning talks but don't see the path to giving one. I know they exist because more often than not, I am one of them. (First piece of advice: You know that thing you joke on twitter about quitting your job to go do full time? Give a talk about that - I did.) 

All of these links come from [the Technically Speaking newsletter](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking), which I highly recommend. It's run by two women and is about the ups, downs, how-tos, joys and rewards of public speaking. The link goes to back issues on github, but the newsletter itself comes once a week and is the absolute perfect length - I always have time to read the whole thing.

I've pulled out links from 2016 with a focus on lightning talks, inspiration, and the odd bit of talk advice that is equally applicable to short, neighborhood talks as it is to full-length, national ones.
